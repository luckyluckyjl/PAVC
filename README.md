This is an official pytorch implementation of the paper: Arbitrary Voice Conversion via Phoneme Attention

Demo:https://luckyluckyjl.github.io/PAVC-demo/

> **Abstract:** Arbitrary voice conversion, which is also called zero-shot voice conversion, is a challenging task that involves transforming voices from one speaker to another. Most of the existing solutions either compress the speaker information of an utterance into a fixed-length vector and then directly fuse the deep content information without considering the ground content, or adaptively normalize deep content features with the style to match their global statistics. In this paper, we proposed a phoneme-based voice conversion approach, which broke the fixed-length style embedding and  easily achieved arbitrary voice conversion. The code and pre-trained model are available at luckyluckyjl/PAVC.
